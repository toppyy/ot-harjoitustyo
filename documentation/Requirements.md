# Requirements

##  Purpose
 
The purpose of this application is to provide the user an easy access to statistical analysis. 

## Functionality

### The "bare minimum" version
- The user is able to load a dataset for analysis (a CSV-file for example). (DONE)
- The user is able to view a part of the loaded dataset
- The user can perform and view results of simple descriptive statistical analysis. For example:
    - Summary statistics (mean, standard deviation etc.) (DONE)
    - Simple plots (e.g. scatterplot, barplot) (DONE)
    - Cross-tabulations (Summary tables DONE)

### Further development ideas
- The user can manipulate the dataset
    - Type conversions
    - New variables
- The user can save a dataset for reuse
- The user can apply other statistical analysis methods:
    - Simple linear regression
    - Logistic regression
